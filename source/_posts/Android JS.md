So The past week I have been working on some flappy bird clones, I wanted to see if I could make a accully fun and original noc off of the game. After a lot of variations, I came to this, It was called Flappy Fliped. Why did it always have to be a bird. So i thought why not be a baloon or a bubble or a umbrella. Instead of falling you would float to the top. And clicking would make you come down just a blip. Then I thought could i put this on Android. So I bought a cheap 20$ Phone from Fred Myers and got to work. I had found this cool framwork or API, Kinda lik Electron or Tauri but for Android. It is Called Android JS. You can just coppie and past your HTML JS and CSS and then it will spit a APK. So I through it over to the phone and of course it dident work. But at least the Android JS Works, Witch was sick. To conclude if you ever need to make a android app or game with just HTML and CSS I would segjust using Android JS
