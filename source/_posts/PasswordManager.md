So Recently I have only been using a few password for everything. I realized that this is really bad practice. So i did some reserch into some free password managers, I realized they are all pretty bad or cost to get the full thing. So I just wanted to make my own. I was used to wrighting in Javascript and I could just use Tauri to convert it to a Exacutable. So I Started working on it. I Setup a server on my local host, It would store the password and send them back. I set up the UI and it was working pretty good. It still needs a lot more work but this was just a proof a concept that I coud do it.
