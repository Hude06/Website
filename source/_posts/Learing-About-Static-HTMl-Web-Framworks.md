Hexo, A Static HTML Web framwork that lets you take a markdown file and convert it to html. It was extreamly simple to set up, It only took me about 20 minuits to set up and instead of using my crappy wordpress setup. I can just use plain old old markdown. It is so nice, I can just use one command and i have a new post.
