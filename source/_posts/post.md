## TBS Tango 2
I have been flying FPV for about 3 years now, and I have loved every part of it. Getting to fly through the sky doing flips, chasing cars. One thing that makes the experience really good is the TBS Tango 2. I know it is pricy for some but if you have to money I would definity sugest getting it. First the UI is really nice and clean, There is just so much room for flexability. Second the rango is insane on it. I have flown over 2 miles out, No issue. Third is the easability, It is just so easy to bind and then to get your quad in the sky. Lastly the battery life is really good, AI can go at least 5 flights and my battery is fine. It is also so nice to be able to charge with a usb c cable. Witch means you could just bring a battery pack for longer flights.
